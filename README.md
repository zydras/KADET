## PLOT INTRO 
The original Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. KADET adapted this idea into a simpler less chaotic roleplay-based game built on the lore backdrop of the Korps (pronounced 'Core') and its worldbuilding. The plot of this specific codebase is that, under the guise of two companies, KADET is the Korps' space operations wing: CosmiC (pronounced 'cosmic sea') handles traditional rocketry and satellite production, where Starfall Aerospace handles crew capability, and is responsible for the Korps' single-stage-to-orbit spaceplanes. Through these shell companies, the Korps is able to maintain a full space program without raising a significant amount of suspicion. This has been followed with the proper establishment of a moonbase on the backside of the moon in order to form the backbone of Project Launchpad, which will allow for further exploration into the solar system. In the meantime, the well-hidden moonbase allows the Korps to proceed unmonitored.

### CURRENT DAY
The Korps moonbase, known as KADET 13 by its crew - a number earned as symbolism for the 13th manned flight that delivered the initial astronauts on the moon - sends feedback from their scientific researches into the potential searches of lunar caverns and returns with the discovery of a new element: Morphia. Initial digs reveal the material to date from roughly the 3000 BC era, albeit hard to precisely set a date due to the lack of sedimentation found on earth. The crystalline material holds incredible power and shares a variety of characteristics to many well-known elements, typically compared to a highly combustible plutonium submatter.

Today's shift: Get that Morphia up, keep the moonbase active, and be very normal about women.
